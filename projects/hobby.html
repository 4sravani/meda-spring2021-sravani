        <p>Hi, my name is Sravani, I am from the South Bay and mother of two wonderful boys. My favorite hobby is gardening, especially container gardening. I have been gardening for the last 15 years. Gardening gives me immense pleasure, self satisfaction and has also  taught me to be patient. I have discovered that it is actually a great stress buster too ! I love nature, the potted plants takes me close to nature every day. My family is equally involved in tending all the plants, friends also enjoy our garden when they come home.</p>

        <p>Container gardening, as the name implies is gardening in containers.Starting container gardening is very easy and it does not cost a fortune.It is  ideal for those who have little or no space. Containers can be used to grow vegetables, herbs, flowers. The biggest advantage is containers can be moved to  different spots. It can be hanged from the porch, mounted onto a patio wall , placed on a pedestal and even on the kitchen window for growing herbs. The possibilities are endless. It is not always necessary to put gravel in the container to prevent soil drainage, a folded paper towel or newspaper works just fine. If the container is one gallon or less it is a good idea to use houseplant potting soil instead of regular soil mix.Container size is very important, if multiple plants are used then a large container would be ideal so that roots can grow properly and the plants have good breathing space around them.
        </p>
        <p>Different containers can be used for gardening: </p>
        <ul>

        <p>Watering the container plants is very important. It has to be done regularly, sometimes the smaller containers should  be wanted twice a day over the summer as the soil dries out pretty quickly.. Regular fertilizing is necessary, at least once every two weeks for healthy growth. Compost tea, fish emulsion diluted in water or any store bought fertilizers, especially soluble ones works great. Pay attention to bugs attacks, especially  aphids or mites. Regular spraying with soap and water helps to eradicate them. Prune the plants regularly to keep them healthy. Don‚Äôt forget to remove spent flowers, dried leaves and  branches to make the container plants look nice.
