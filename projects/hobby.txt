Hi, my name is Sravani, I am from the South Bay and mother of two wonderful boys. My favorite hobby is gardening, especially container gardening. I have been gardening for the last 15 years. Gardening gives me immense pleasure, self satisfaction and has also  taught me to be patient. I have discovered that it is actually a great stress buster too !

Starting container gardening is very easy and it does not cost a fortune.It is  ideal for those who have little or no space. Containers can be used to grow vegetables, herbs, flowers. The biggest advantage is containers can be moved to  different spots. It can be hanged from the porch, mounted onto a patio wall , placed on a pedestal and even on the kitchen window for growing herbs. The possibilities are endless. It is not always necessary to put gravel in the container to prevent soil drainage, a folded paper towel or newspaper works just fine. If the container is one gallon or less it is a good idea to use houseplant potting soil instead of regular soil mix.Container size is very important, if multiple plants are used then a large container would be ideal so that roots can grow properly and the plants have good breathing space around them.
